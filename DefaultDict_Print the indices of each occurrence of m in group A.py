from collections import defaultdict
d = defaultdict(list)

x,y=[int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
list1=[]
for i in range(x+y):
    if(i<x):
        d[input()].append(i+1)
    else:
        list1.append(str(input()))    
for i in list1:
    if i in d:
        print(" ".join(str(x) for x in d[str(i)]))
    else:
        print(-1)
