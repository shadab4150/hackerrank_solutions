"""
Problem Statement
You are given N sticks, where the length of each stick is a positive integer. A cut operation is performed on the sticks such that all of them are reduced by the length of the smallest stick.
Suppose we have six sticks of the following lengths:
5 4 4 2 2 8
Then, in one cut operation we make a cut of length 2 from each of the six sticks. For the next cut operation four sticks are left (of non-zero length), whose lengths are the following: 
3 2 2 6
The above step is repeated until no sticks are left.
Given the length of N sticks, print the number of sticks that are left before each subsequent cut operations.
Note: For each cut operation, you have to recalcuate the length of smallest sticks (excluding zero-length sticks).
Input Format 
The first line contains a single integer N. 
The next line contains N integers: a0, a1,...aN-1 separated by space, where ai represents the length of ith stick.
Output Format 
For each operation, print the number of sticks that are cut, on separate lines.
